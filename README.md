# Huffman Encoder
* Implements a binary tree to assign the optimal code given a set of symbols and weights

The program requires a .txt file for input. The .txt file should have a set of symbols and a weight associated with each symbol. The Huffman encoder will then assign the optimal code given the .txt file. The code assigned can be binary and works for any radix up to 9.
